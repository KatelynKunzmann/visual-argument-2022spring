## Cryptocurrency Adoption

### Katelyn Kunzmann

I am arguing for cryptocurrency adoption based upon the premise of hyperinflation in this country as well as others. We live in a time of financial insecurity, unprecedented inflation, and our government continues to help the banks not the people in times of financial crisis. I want to convince people to at least try to venture into the world of crypto, since its implications for modern society are absolutely astonishing and necessary. Venezuela was one of the top nations to rapidly adopt crypto in 2021 and for good reason. Sound and secure money is a human right and cryptocurrency embodies this. I want to help bridge the gap between crypto and the general public.
